      Access to AWS resources is a consolidated outcome of a number of policies spread
      across AWS IAM and some services. Our tool gives you an <u>easily comprehensible
      view</u> of access privileges in your AWS account besides easily <u>search</u> for specific
      access to a user or a specific resource and also the specific actions that a user
      is allowed to perform.
